# s1ghtys dotfiles

My (stolen, actually) Arch + Hyprland setup with install.sh file.

Clone this repo and do the following:

git clone https://github.com/s1ghty/dotfiles.git

cd dotfiles

./install.sh

And after reboot the system! (Check if everything works fine, and also change the directory for the wallpaper)
